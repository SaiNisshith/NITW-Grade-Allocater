# NITW-Grade-Allocater
Created a Grade Allocater of National Institute of Technology Warangal, where this can be used for assigning the grades to the Students in there individual subjects.

All the rules allocating the grade has been taken care very strictly, and it will produce the 99.9999% best result.

As this is the CPP file it will again becomes storing the output data, so here I added the output data into the result.txt in the order(ROLL NO - TOTAL MARKS -ASSIGNED GRADE). This file location of result.txt will be in the same folder where the the CPP file was stored.

Care has been taken for making as User-Friendly as possible.

So I request the user, to follow all the instructions and procced furthur by following them for the best results.
